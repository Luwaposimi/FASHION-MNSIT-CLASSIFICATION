# Fashion MNIST Classification Assignment

## Overview
This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implementation using Keras in Python to classify the Fashion MNIST dataset. The model consists of six layers and is trained to predict clothing categories.

## Instructions
1. *Requirements*: Install TensorFlow and Keras (pip install tensorflow).
2. *Run the Code*: Execute python fashion_mnist_cnn.py in a Python environment.
3. *Output*: The script trains the model, evaluates it, and displays predictions for the first two test images along with their visualizations.

## Code Structure
- fashion.ipynb: Main Python script containing the CNN implementation and predictions.

## Notes
- The model achieves a test accuracy printed at the end of execution.
- Predictions and true labels for two sample images are printed and visualized.
- Python version 3.11
